# These are my personal Java coding solutions
# for the CtCI-6th-edition book
Partial Solutions for [Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Edition] by [Gayle Laakmann McDowell]

Crowdsourcing solutions for every widely used programming language. **Contributions welcome**.

## Cloning

Solutions in Java are contained directly in this repo and are the same solutions found
in. Solutions in other programming languages are contributed by the community and each have
their own dedicated repos which are referenced from this repo as git submodules. What this means for cloning:

- If you're only interested in my Java solutions:

        git clone git@github.com:diego-maquill/Java_Coding_Challenges.git

### Work Flow
1. Fork the appropriate repo for your language to your GitHub user. (see [Where to submit pull requests](#where-to-submit-pull-requests))
2. Write quality code and lint if applicable.
3. Add tests if applicable.
4. Open a pull request and provide a descriptive comment for what you did.

### Where to submit original pull requests

Pull requests pertaining to Java solutions should be submitted to the main [CtCI-6th-Edition repo](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition). Please submit pull requests for all other languages to the appropriate language-specific repo.

### Adding a new Language

Solutions in other languages are welcome too and should follow this workflow:

1. Create the new repo under your own GitHub user account and start contributing solutions. The repo name should follow this naming convention: `CtCI-6th-Edition-<language>`.
2. Open an [issue on the CtCI-6th-Edition repo](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition/issues) to request that your solution repo be promoted to join the careercup GitHub organization and referenced from the main repo as a git submodule.
3. If your request is approved, navigate to your repo's settings page and select the "Transfer Ownership" option, and specify "careercup" as the new owner.
